    <h3>The Acropolis of Athens</h3>
    <p>The Acropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel located on a rocky outcrop above the city of Athens and contains the remains
    of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historical significance, the most famous being the Parthenon. The word 
    acropolis is from the Greek words ἄκρον (akron, "highest point, extremity") and πόλις (polis, "city"). The term acropolis is generic 
    and there are many other acropoleis in Greece. During ancient times the Acropolis of Athens was known also more properly as Cecropia, 
    after the legendary serpent-man, Cecrops, the supposed first Athenian king.</p>

    <h3>Panathenaic Stadium</h3>
    <p>A stadium was built on the site of a simple racecourse by the Athenian statesman Lykourgos (Lycurgus) c. 330 BC, primarily for the Panathenaic 
    Games. It was rebuilt in marble by Herodes Atticus, an Athenian Roman senator, by 144 AD and had a capacity of 50,000 seats. After the rise of 
    Christianity in the 4th century it was largely abandoned. The stadium was excavated in 1869 and hosted the Zappas Olympics in 1870 and 1875. 
    After being refurbished, it hosted the opening and closing ceremonies of the first modern Olympics in 1896 and was the venue for 4 of the 9 
    contested sports. It was used for various purposes in the 20th century and was once again used as an Olympic venue in 2004. It is the finishing 
    point for the annual Athens Classic Marathon. It is also the last venue in Greece from where the Olympic flame handover ceremony to the host nation takes place.</p>
    <h3>Information first Olympic Games:</h3>
    <p>On April 6, 1896, the Olympic Games, a long-lost tradition of ancient Greece, are reborn in Athens 1,500 years after being banned by Roman Emperor Theodosius 
    I. At the opening of the Athens Games, King Georgios I of Greece and a crowd of 60,000 spectators welcomed athletes from 13 nations to the international competition.
    The first recorded Olympic Games were held at Olympia in the Greek city-state of Elis in 776 B.C., but it is generally accepted that the Olympics were at least 500 
    years old at that time. The ancient Olympics, held every four years, occurred during a religious festival honoring the Greek god Zeus. In the eighth century B.C., contestants 
    came from a dozen or more Greek cities, and by the fifth century B.C. from as many as 100 cities from throughout the Greek empire. Initially, Olympic competition was limited 
    to foot races, but later a number of other events were added, including wrestling, boxing, horse and chariot racing, and military competitions.</p>
