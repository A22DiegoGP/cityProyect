    <h1>History and Legends of Athens</h1>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The oldest known human presence in Athens is the Cave of Schist, which has been dated to between the 11th and 7th millennia BC.
    Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 5,000 years (3000 BC). By 1400 BC, the settlement had become an important
    centre of the Mycenaean civilization, and the Acropolis was the site of a major Mycenaean fortress, whose remains can be recognised
    from sections of the characteristic Cyclopean walls. Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as Mycenae and Pylos, it is not known
    whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200 BC, an event often attributed to a Dorian invasion, and the Athenians always maintained 
    that they were pure Ionians with no Dorian element. However, Athens, like many other Bronze Age settlements, went into economic decline 
    for around 150 years afterwards.</p>
    <h3>Legends</h3>
    <p>The history of the Athenians begins with a myth. In Athens, like a bit everywhere else and from immemorial times, the inhabitants have 
    transmitted to each generation the history of their city, in the form of songs, these legends are often a reflection of true facts, deformed 
    by time and mythology. According to the legend, in the beginning was a goddess, Athena, which was identified at the city she created. Another
    version of the myth claims that Athena was not the founder, but only the goddess who gave it her name and became its protective.
    This legend tells, that when the city which will become Athens had hardly been founded, the Fact (the Destiny) decided it would become very 
    rich, thrives, and the most powerful city of all Greece. So,Athena decided to take it under its guard. But, Poseidon also wished it under its 
    protection, since it was close to the sea.
    Athena and Poseidon were opposed, none wanted to yield the young city to the other. Zeus does not succeed in putting them in agreement, so 
    Athena proposed to let decide the citizens of whom would be their guard. Athena and Poseidon joined together the people of the city on the 
    acropolis and said that they were going each one to offer a giftÂ²: the one considered to be the best would give the victory. Poseidon revealed 
    a splendid horse, Athena gave birth from the ground an olive-tree. An elder ahead affirm that the two gifts were worthy to be chosen, and 
    precised: the horse represents power, courage, the war, whereas the olive-tree prudence, serenity, peace. The old man also said that the war 
    could bring richnesses, on the other hand, even if peace brought less beautiful and original goods, they were more secure and durable. All approved 
    and chose the gift of Athena, which gave finally its name to the city.
    After the choice, the citizens promised to Poseidon to raise a temple for him and that they would make him the offerings due to keep his favor.</p>
